          <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
          <p>Supercell was founded on the idea of giving game developers and teams the independence to decide what kinds of games they make and how they choose to make them. Over a decade and five global games later, our dream still stands: to create great games that as many people as possible play for years and that are remembered forever.
          </p>
          <p>We believe games have the power to bring people around the world together and closer to each other. We work to create new, innovative, memorable experiences no one has played before. This is why we try to design games that excite wide and diverse player communities as well as to expand the audience for otherwise smaller “niche” game concepts.

         <h2>Career</h2>
         <h4>WHY YOU MIGHT LOVE IT HERE</h4>

         <p>Supercell is made up of small, independent teams trusted to work together in pursuit of our dream: to create games for as many people as possible that are played for years and remembered forever. Each team has the freedom to pursue this dream as they see fit. It’s up to them to decide what is best for Supercell, and for our players. We trust each other, even when we disagree.

         To make five games, we’ve killed over a dozen, like Smash Land, Rush Wars and Hay Day Pop. In the end, only our game teams can make the decision to launch or shut down their project.
         We encourage people to use their talents where they have the most impact. As well as helping us remain small, it means you may have the opportunity to work on a project you weren't originally hired for. Of course you'll always be consulted first and play an active part in the decision (and likely even moving your own desk).
            
         Your colleagues will trust you to do what makes sense and what is right for Supercell.</p>

         If you love to think, talk, play and make games, Supercell is the place for you. We’ve built a company of proactive and independent teams with the freedom to do what they think is best for their players, our games and the company at large.</p>
